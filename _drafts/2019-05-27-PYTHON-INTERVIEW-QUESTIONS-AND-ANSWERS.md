Q1) What does the <yield> keyword do in python?
The yield keyword can turn ant function into a generator. It works like a standard return keyword. But it will always return a generator object. A function can have multiple calls the <yield> keyword.

Example:

def testgen(index):

weekdays = [‘sun’,’mon’,’tue’,’wed’,’thu’,’fri’,’sat’]

yield weekdays[index]

yield weekdays[index+1]

day = testgen(0)

print next(day), next(day)

Output:

Sun mon

Q2) What are the different ways to create an empty NumPy array in python?
There are two methods we can apply to create empty NumPy arrays.

The first method.

import numpy

numpy.array([])

The second method.

# Make an empty NumPy array

numpy.empty(shape=(0,0))

Q3) Can’t concat bytes to str?
This is providing to be a rough transition to python on here

f = open( ‘myfile’, ‘a+’ )

f.write(‘test string’ + ‘\n’)

key = “pass:hello”

plaintext = subprocess.check_output([‘openssl’,’aes-128-cbc’,’-d’, ‘-in’,test,’-base64′,’-pass’, key])

print (plaintext)

f.write (plaintext + ‘\n’)

f.close()

The output file looks like:

test string

Q4) Expline different way to trigger/ raise exception in your python script?
Raise used to manually raise an exception general-form: raise exception-name (“message to be conveyed”).

voting_age = 15

if voting_age < 19: raise ValueError(“voting age should be at least 19 and above”)

output:

ValueError: voting age should be at least 19 and above 2.assert statements are used to tell your program to test that condition attached to assert keyword, and trigger an exception whenever the condition becomes false. Eg: a = -10

assert a > 0 #to raise an exception whenever a is a negative number

Output:

AssertionError

Another way of raising an exception can be done by making a programming mistake, but that is not usually a good way of triggering an exception

Q5) Why is not__getattr__invoked when attr==’__str__’?
The base class object already implements a default __str__ method, and __getattr__function is  called for missing attributes. The example as it we must use the __getattribute__ method instead, but beware of the dangers.

class GetAttr(object):

def __getattribute__(self, attr):

print(‘getattr: ‘ + attr)

if attr == ‘__str__’:

return lambda: ‘[Getattr str]’

else:

return lambda *args: None

A better and more readable solution to simply override the __str__ method explicitly.

class GetAttr(object):

def __getattr__(self, attr):

print(‘getattr: ‘ + attr)

return lambda *args: None

def __str__(self):

return ‘[Getattr str]’

Q6)What do you mean by list comprehension?
The process of creating a list performing some operation on the data so that can be accessed using an iterator is referred to as list comprehension.

EX:

[ord (j) for j in string.ascii_uppercase]
Output:

65,66,67,68,69,70,71,72,73,74,75,76,77,78,79,80,81,82,83,84,85,86,87,88,89,90

Q7) What will be the output of the code:def foo (i=[])?
i.append (1)

return i

>>> foo ()

>>> foo ()

Output:

[1] [1,1]
The argument to the function foo is evaluated once when the function is defined

However since it is a list on every all the list is modified by appending a 1 to it.

Q8) How to Tic tac toe computer move?
Below The code of computer move in the game tic tac toe in python

def computermove(board,computer,human):

movecom=”

rmoves=rd(0,8)

for movecom in legalmoves(board):

board[movecom]=computer

if winner(board)==computer:

return movecom

board[movecom]=”

for movecom in legalmoves(board):

board[movecom]=human

if winner(board)==human:

return movecom

board[movecom]=”

while rmoves not in legalmoves(board):

rtmoves=rd(0,8)

return rmoves

Q9) Explain about ODBC and python?
ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) API standard allows the connections with any database that supports the interface such as the PostgreSQL database or Microsoft access in a transparent manner

Three types of ODBC modules for python:

PythonWin ODBC module – limited development

mxODBC – a commercial product

pyodbc – This is open source python package

Q10) How to implement the decorator function, using dollar ()?
Code:
def dollar(fn):

def new(*args):

return ‘$’ + str(fn(*args))

return new

@dollar

def price(amount, tax_rate):

return amount + amount*tax_rate

print price(100,0.1)

output:
$110

Q11) How to count the number of instance?
You have a class A, you want to count the number of A instance.

Hint: use staticmethod

Example

class A:

total = 0

def __init__(self, name):

self.name = name

A.total += 1

def status():

print “Number of instance (A) : “, A.total

status = staticmethod(status)

a1 = A(“A1”)

a2 = A(“A2”)

a3 = A(“A3”)

a4 = A(“A4”)

A.status()

Output:
The number of instance (A) : 4

Q12) What are the Arithmetic Operators that Python supports?
‘+’     : Addition

‘-’     : Subtraction

‘*’    : Multiplication

‘/’: Division

‘%’: Modulo division

‘**’: Power Of

‘//’: floor div

Python does not support unary operators like ++ or – operators. Python supports “Augmented Assignment Operators”. i.e.,

A += 10 Means A = A+10

B -= 10 Means B = B-10

Q13) How do you reload a Python module?
All that needs to be a module object to the imp.reload() function or just reload() in Python 2.x, and the module will be reloaded from its source file. Any other code references symbols exported by the reloaded module, they still are bound to the original code.

Q14) How does Python handle Compile-time and Run-time code checking?
Python supports compile-time code checking up to some extent. Most checks for variable data types will be postponed until run-time code checking. When an undefined custom function is used, it will move forward with compile-time checking. During runtime, Python raises exceptions against errors.

Q15) What are Supporting Python packages for data science operations?
Pandas: A package providing flexible data structures to work with relational or labeled data.

NumPy: A package that allows working with numerical based data structures like arrays and tensors.

Matplotlib: A 2D rendering engine written for Python.

Tensorflow: A package used for constructing computational graphs.

Q16) What are the ones that can be used with pandas?
A python dict, ndarray or scalar values can be used with Pandas. The passed index is a list of axis labels.

17) How To Add an Index, Row or Column to a Pandas DataFrame?
The index can be added by calling set_index() on programmer DataFrame.

For accessing rows, loc works on labels of programme index, iloc works on the positions in programme index, it is a more complex case: when the index is integer-based, programmer passes a label to ix[index].

Q18) How To Create an Empty DataFrame?
The function that programmer will use is the Pandas Dataframe() function: it requires the programmer to pass the data that programmer wants to put in, the indices and the columns.

Q19) Does Pandas Recognize Dates When Importing Data?
Yes. but programmer needs to help it a tiny bit: add the argument parse_dates when programmer by reading in data from, let is say, a comma-separated value (CSV) file.

Q20) How to convert a NumPy array to a Python List?
Use tolist():

import numpy as np

>>> np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]).tolist()

[[1, 1, 1], [2, 2, 2]]
Q21) How to set the figure title and axes labels font size in Matplotlib?
Functions dealing with text like label, title, etc. accept parameters same as matplotlib.text.Text. For the font size you can use size/fontsize:

Q22) x = [‘android’, ‘basket’, ‘cat’, ‘doctor’, ‘element’, ‘forest’, ‘gun’]

Q71).What is difference between match & search in regex module in python?
Match Checks for a match only at the beginning of the string, while search checks for a match anywhere in the string.

Q72).Can we change tuple values? If yes, give an example.
Since tuple are immutable, so we cannot change tuple value in its original form but we can convert it into list for changing its values and then convert again to tuple.

Below is the example:

my_tuple=(1,2,3,4)

my_list=list(my_tuple)

my_list[2]=9

my_tuple=tuple(my_list)

Q73).What is purpose of __init__ in Class ? Is it necessary to use __init__  while creating a class ?
__init__ is a class contructor in python.  __init__  is called when we create an object for a class and it is used to initialize the attribute of that class.

eg :  def __init__ (self, name ,branch , year)

self.name= name

self.branch = branch

self.year =year

print(“a new student”)

No, It is not necessary to include __init__ as your first function every time in class.

Q74).Can Dictionary have a duplicate keys  ?
Python Doesn’t allow duplicate key  however if a key is duplicated the second key-value pair will overwrite the first as a dictionary can only have one value per key.

For eg :

>>> my_dict={‘a’:1 ,’b’ :2 ,’b’:3}

>>> print(my_dict)

{‘a’: 1, ‘b’: 3}

Q75).What happened if we call a key that is not present in dictionary and how to tackle that kind of error ?
It will return a Key Error . We can use get method to avoid such condition. This method returns the value for the given key, if it is present in the dictionary and if it is not present  it will return None (if get() is used with only one argument).

Dict.get(key, default=None)

Q76).What is difference b/w range and arange function in python?
numpy.arange :  Return evenly spaced values within a given interval. Values are generated within the half-open interval [start, stop) .the interval including start but excluding stop. It return an Array .

numpy.arange([start, ]stop, [step, ]dtype=None)

Range : The range function returns a list of numbers between the two arguments (or one) you pass it.

Q77).What is difference b/w panda series and dictionary in python?
Dictionaries are python’s default data structures which allow you to store key: value pairs and it offers some built-in methods to manipulate your data.

Q78).Why it need to be create a virtual environment before staring an project in Django ?
A Virtual Environment is an isolated working copy of Python which allows you to work on a specific project without worry of affecting other projects.

Benefit of creating virtualenv :

We can create multiple virtualenv , so that every project have a different set of packages .

For eg. if one project we run on two different version of Django , virtualenv can keep thos projects fully separate to satisfy both requirements at once.It makes easy for us to release our project with its own dependent modules.

Q79).How to write a text from from another text file in python ?
Below is the code for the same.

import os

os.getcwd()

os.chdir(‘/Users/username/Documents’)

file = open(‘input.txt’ ,’w’)

with open(“output.txt”, “w”) as fw, open(“input.txt”,”r”) as fr:

Q80).what is difference between input and raw_input?
There is no raw_input() in python 3.x  only input() exists. Actually, the old raw_input() has been renamed to input(), and the old input() is gone, but can easily be simulated by using eval(input()). In python 3.x  We  can  manually compile and then eval for getting old functionality.

python2.x	python3.x
raw_input()	input()
input()	eval(input())
Q81).What are all important modules in python  required for a Data Science ?
Below are important module for a Data Science :

NumPy
SciPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Seaborn
Bokeh
Plotly
SciKit-Learn
Theano
TensorFlow
Keras
Q82).What is use of list comprehension ?
List comprehensions is used to transform one list into another list. During this process, list items are  conditionally included in the new list and each items are transformed as required. Eg.

my_list=[]

my_list1=[2,3,4,5]

Using  “for “ loop :

for i in my_list1:

my_list.append(i*2)

Using List comprehension :

my_list2=[i*2 for i in my_list1]

print(my_list2)

Q83). what is lambda function ?
lambda function is used for creating small, one-time and anonymous function objects in Python.

Q84).what is use of set in python?
A set is a  type of python data Structure which is unordered and unindexed. It  is declared in curly braces . sets are used when you required only unique elements .my_set={ a ,b ,c,d}

Q85). Does python has private keyword in python ? how to make any variable private in python ?
It does not have private keyword in python and for any instance variable to make it private you can __  prefix in the  variable so that it will not be visible to the code outside of the class .

Eg .  Class A:

def __init__(self):

self.__num=345

def printNum(self):

print self.__num

Q86).what is pip and when it is used ?
it is a  package management system and it is used to install many python package. Eg. Django , mysql.connector

Syntax : pip install packagename

pip install Django : to install Django module

Q87). what is head and tail method for Data frames in pandas ?
Ans : Head : it will give the first N rows of Dataframe.

Tail : it will give last N rows of Dataframe.

By default it is 5.

Q88). How to change a string in list ?
we can use split method to change an existing string into list.

s= ‘Hello sam good morning ’

s.split()

print(s)

[‘hello’ , ‘sam’ , ‘good’ , ‘morning’]
Q89). How to take hello as output from below nested list using indexing concepting in python.
my_list=[1,2,3,[5,6,7, [2,7,[‘hello’], 4,5]],3,4]

Ans : my_list[3][3][2][0]

print(my_list)

Q90). What is list when we have to use ?
Lists always store homogeneous elements.  we have to use the lists when the data is same type and when accessing is more insteading of inserting  in memory.

Q91). What is dict when we have to use ?
Dict is used to store key value pairs and key is calculated using hash key. This is used when we want to access data in O(1) time as big O notation in average case. Dict I used in u can say super market to know the price of corresponding while doing billing

Q92). What is tuple when we have to use ?
Tuple is hetrogenous and we have to use when data is different types.

Q93). Is String Immutable ?
Yes because it creates object in memory so if you want to change through indexing it will throw an exception since it can’t be changes I,e immutable.

Q94). How to handle Exception ?
We can handle exceptions by using try catch block . we can also else block in python to make it executed based on condition.

Q95). Will python work multiple inheritance?
Yes it works .by sequentially referring parent class one by one.

Q96). Will class members accessible by instances of class?
Yes by referring corresponding attributes we can access.

Q97). What are Special methods in python and how to implement?
Special methods in python are __init__,__str__,__iter__,__del__

__init__-it will initialize when class loads.

__str__-It is used to represent object in a string format.

__iter__-it I used to define iteration based on requirements.

__del__-It is used to destroy object when it is not required  for memory optimization.

Q98). How to handle deadlock in python.
By providing synchronization methods so that each thread access one at a time.It will lock another thread until thread fine it execution.

Q99). How for loop will works in python?

Yes we can use. once all the for loop is successfully executed the else part is going to execute, If there are any error occurs or any break happened in the loop then the else is not going to execute

Ex: for I in list1:

print(i)

Else:

print(execution done)

even we can use else with while also

Python employs a built-in garbage receiver, which salvages all the available memory including offloads it to some heap space.
Q252) What is means by string Python?
A string in Python is a mixture of the alpha-numeric volume of characters. They are clear of objects Volume. It suggests that both don’t help move once all get assigned a value. Python provides to programs of join(), replace(), or split() to alter strings variable.

Q253) What does the meaning of Slicing in python?
Python Slicing is defined as Lists of  Tuples and Arrays Volume function. The Lists element function has a default bit fo the functionality while slicing. If there is a no consequence of before that first colon, it expects to begin at the start index of the list.

Q259) What is meant by“Call By Value” In Python?
In call-by-value, that argument to be valued expression or value becomes connected to the particular variable in this function.
Python command treats that variable being confined within the function-level field.
Any changes done to this variable will continue local and order reflect outside the function.
Q260) What does means by “Call By Reference” In Python?
The Call-by-reference we pass as an argument by reference volume, then it is possible because of an absolute source on the use, first then some simple copy. In such any case, any change to the discussion instructions further is obvious to the caller.

Q271) What does means by split do in Python?
This is the opposite of order which mixes or combines strings within one. To do this, you practice this split function value. What it takes is divided or develop up a string and attach that data into each order collection using a specified separator. If none separator is specified while you charge against specific function, whitespace order signify done by default.

Q272) How do you convert a string to in python?

Q277) Difference between Python and Java?
The Two biggest difference languages signify that the Java is one the statically typed program coding language and Python is one of the dynamical typed. Python is very heavily code programming language but dynamically typed. In certain means types in one code remain confined to strongly Copied something at runtime.

Q278) How Can you declare the variables function in Python?
In Java or C, every variable must be certified before it can be used. Declaring the variable means connecting it to a data type value function. Declaration of variables is expected in Python. You can specify an integer value function to a variable, use it is an integer value function for a while and when specifying a string to the variable function.

Q279) How to declare the variables function in Python?
Python is defined as a dynamically typed variable, which indicates that you have to declare what type each function variable is. In Python, variables do a storage placeholder during texts and numbers variable. It needs to convert one name so that you remain qualified to get this again. The variable does forever assign with an equal sign, replaced by the value of the variable function.
